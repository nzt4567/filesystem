filesystem
==========

Simple filesystem. Allows for saving/loading files & searching for a file. Works on the same principles as FAT.

This code is still under development and this is just a debug version (read: the code is a mess) - lot of comments, debug prints, ... (mostly in Czech). All functions are working and heavily tested. No makefile included (yet - it will be here with publishing a non-debug version). 

usage
====

You would have to go through the code to make sure you understand at least a little bit of how it works and where do you want to use which functions. As I don't suppose this will ever find any real usage it's probably going to stay that way BUT feel free to email me if you have any questions.


warning
======

as usual, here it applies twice that much, although quite tested, do not blame me for this "educational-purposes-only" filesystem mistakes ;)
